This repository demonstrates a potential race condition in a simple VHDL multiplier. The issue arises because the assignments to the `product` and `result` signals are not synchronized with the clock.  This can lead to incorrect results, especially at high clock speeds. The solution shows how to mitigate this by using a more robust approach that guarantees completion before the next clock cycle.
